### Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. It can be a powerful tool to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Mostly, customer is segmented in four greater groups:
1. Demographic information, such as gender, age, marital status, income, education and occupation.
2. Geographical information, which differs depending on the scope of the company. It can be specific towns or countries, or a customer's city, state and country of residence.
3. Psychographics, such as social class, lifestyle and personality traits.
4. Behavioral data, such as spending and consuming habits, product/services usage, and desired benefits.

Our motivation in this customer segmentation process is to take advantage of this to:
- Determine appropriate product pricing
- Develop customized marketing campaigns
- Design an optimal distribution strategy
- Choose specific product features for deployment
- Prioritize new product development efforts
